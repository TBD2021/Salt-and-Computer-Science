## 树

### 树的遍历（未完待续）

- **深度优先遍历/Depth First Traversal**

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

DFS使用栈来存储次序信息。

- **宽度优先遍历&层次遍历/Breadth First Traversal&Level Order Traversal**

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 

BFS使用队列来存储次序信息。

- **宽度优先遍历&层次遍历**

  - 宽度优先遍历：It explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level
  - 层次遍历：Each node at level i is processed before any node at level i+1

对于Tree，宽度优先遍历和层次遍历是完全没有区别的。对于Graph，有时并不是每一层都是完整的，此时层次遍历的概念就不再适用，而宽度优先遍历的概念依然适用。

```html
level
  1          1
            / \
  2        /   3
          /   /
  3      2   4

Level-order traversal: 1, 3, 2, 4.
Breadth-first traversal: 1, 2, 3, 4.
```

### 图的定义

A Graph denoted by *G=(V, E)*, is a non-linear data structure defined by a finite set of vertices *V*, and a set of edges *E* consisting of ordered or unordered pairs of vertices from *V*. 

- **顶点与边**
  - 顶点 (Vertices)
  - 边 (Edges)
  - 顶点的度 (Degree of a Vertex): The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident with that vertex.

- **路径**
  - 路径 (Path): A path is a sequence of vertices with the property that each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertex next to it. A path that does not repeat vertices is called a simple path.

- **环**
  - 环 (Cycle): A Cycle in graph is a path in which **only** the first and last vertices are equal.
  - 回路 (Circuit): A circuit is a path in graph in which the first and last vertices are equal.
  
- **自环与重边**
  - 自环 (Loop): A loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
  - 重边 (Multiple Edges): Multiple edges are two or more edges connecting the same two vertices. 

### 图的类型

- **有向图与无向图**
  - 有向图 (Directed Graph): A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.
  - 无向图 (Undirected Graph): A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge. 

- **有权图与无权图**
  - 有权图 (Weighted Graph): A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph. 
  - 无权图 (Unweighted Graph): An unweighted graph is a graph in which the edges do not have weights or costs associated with them. Instead, they simply represent the presence of a connection between two vertices.

- **简单图与多重图**
  - 简单图 (Simple Graph): A simple graph is a graph that does not allow for loops or multiple edges.
  - 多重图 (Multigraph，or Pseudograph): A multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges.

- **稠密图与稀疏图**
  - 稠密图 (Dense Graph): A graph with many edges compared to the number of vertices.
  - 稀疏图 (Sparse Graphs): A graph with relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices.

### 图的表示：邻接矩阵与邻接表

Assume the graph *G=(V, E)* contains *|V|* vertices and *|E|* edges.  
  - **邻接矩阵 (Adijacency Matrix)：** 一个 *V×V* 二维数组（矩阵），在二维数组中保存每两个节点间的联通关系。
  - **邻接表 (Adijacency List)：** 一个长度为 *V* 的哈希表，其中每个数据对的 Key 值存储节点，Value 值存储从该节点出发的所有相邻节点。

</div>

在图的邻接表表示中，如果 G 是一个有向图，则所有链表的长度之和为 *|E|*；如果 G 是一个无向图，则所有链表的长度之和为 *2|E|*。


**Trade-Off：邻接矩阵与邻接表**

时间复杂度：

|Operation|Adijacency Matrix|Adjacency List|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Store graph|O(V<sup>2</sup>)|O(V+E)|
|Add vertex|O(V<sup>2</sup>)|O(1)|
|Add edge|O(1)|O(1)|
|Remove vertex|O(V<sup>2</sup>)|O(E)|
|Remove Edge|O(1)|O(V)|
|判断已知位置的<br>两个节点是否邻接|O(1)|O(V)|

**结论：**
- 大多数情况下，邻接表都优于邻接矩阵（不过，邻接表和邻接矩阵在渐进意义下至少是一样有效的）。
- 稀疏图适合用邻接表，稠密图或必须很快判断两个给定顶点是否存在连接边时，适合用邻接矩阵。
