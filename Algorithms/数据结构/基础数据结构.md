 ### 图的定义

A Graph denoted by *G=(V, E)*, is a non-linear data structure defined by a finite set of vertices *V*, and a set of edges *E* consisting of ordered or unordered pairs of vertices from *V*. 

- **顶点与边**
  - 顶点(Vertices)
  - 边(Edges)
  - 顶点的度(Degree of a Vertex): The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident with that vertex.

- **路径**
  - 路径(Path): A path is a sequence of vertices with the property that each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertex next to it. A path that does not repeat vertices is called a simple path.

- **环**
  - 环(Cycle): A Cycle in graph is a path in which **only** the first and last vertices are equal.
  - 回路(Circuit): A circuit is a path in graph in which the first and last vertices are equal.
  
- **自环与重边**
  - 自环(Loop): A loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
  - 重边(Multiple Edges): Multiple edges are two or more edges connecting the same two vertices. 

### 图的类型

- **有向图与无向图**
  - 有向图(Directed Graph): A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.
  - 无向图(Undirected Graph): A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge. 

- **有权图与无权图**
  - 有权图(Weighted Graph): A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph. 
  - 无权图(Unweighted Graph): An unweighted graph is a graph in which the edges do not have weights or costs associated with them. Instead, they simply represent the presence of a connection between two vertices.

- **简单图与多重图**
  - 简单图(Simple Graph): A simple graph is a graph that does not allow for loops or multiple edges.
  - 多重图(Multigraph,or Pseudograph): A multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges.

- **稠密图与稀疏图**
  - 稠密图(Dense Graph): A graph with many edges compared to the number of vertices.
  - 稀疏图(Sparse Graphs): A graph with relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices.

## 图的表示

### 邻接矩阵与邻接表

  Assume the graph *G=(V, E)* contains *|V|* vertices and *|E|* edges.  
  - 邻接矩阵(Adijacency Matrix)：一个 *V×V* 二维数组（矩阵），在二维数组中保存每两个节点间的联通关系。
  - 邻接表(Adijacency List)：一个长度为 *V* 的哈希表，其中每个数据对的Key值存储节点，Value值存储从该节点出发的所有相邻节点。

在图的邻接表表示中，如果G是一个有向图，则所有链表的长度之和为 *|E|*；如果G是一个无向图，则所有链表的长度之和为*2|E|*。

### 对比：邻接矩阵与邻接表

时间复杂度:

|Operation|Adijacency Matrix|Adjacency List|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Store graph|O(V<sup>2</sup>)|O(V+E)|
|Add vertex|O(V<sup>2</sup>)|O(1)|
|Add edge|O(1)|O(1)|
|Remove vertex|O(V<sup>2</sup>)|O(E)|
|Remove Edge|O(1)|O(V)|
|判断已知位置的<br>两个节点是否邻接|O(1)|O(V)|

结论：

      - 大多数情况下，邻接表都优于邻接矩阵（不过，邻接表和邻接矩阵在渐进意义下至少是一样有效的）。
      - 稀疏图更适合使用邻接表，但是当遇到稠密图或必须很快判断两个给定顶点是否存在连接边时，更适合使用邻接矩阵。
